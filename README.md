LKARS consit of various setup and configuration utilities, including `raspi-config` for Raspbian-based systems and `armbian-config` for Armbian-based systems. These utilities provide a user-friendly interface for configuring various system settings and options and ability to Test and optimize system performance.

## Easy setup

To set up LKARS, you will need to have `wget` and `bash` installed on your system. These are commonly included by default on most Linux distributions.

To set up LKARS, simply run the following command:

```bash
wget -O /tmp/setup.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tearran/lkars/master/setup ; bash /tmp/setup.sh
```

## Target Systems
- Debian

## General hardware

LKARS has been tested and is known to work with the following hardware:

- Raspberry Pi B+, 3, Zero, Zero W, Zero 2
- Banana Pi, M2 Zero

## Future Work
- Integration with additional sensor types
- Enhanced customization options for users
- Improved documentation and user guides
- Robust error handling and reporting
